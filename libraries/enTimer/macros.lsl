ENTIMER_ENABLE_PREEMPTION is required to enable "preemption" mode, which exposes
the enTimer_SetPreempt accessor function. If enTimer_SetPreempt(1) is called,
all future timer events will skip the slow enTimer_Check call and, in
combination with EN_TIMER, pass the timer event directly to en_timer.

This is useful for scripts that need to temporarily process high-frequency timer
events and can tolerate delaying enTimer triggers until enTimer_SetPreempt(0) is
called.
