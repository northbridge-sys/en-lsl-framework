# The "En Style"

En's reliance on a combination of the C preprocessor and LSL means that the available syntax for any sort of standardized libraries or extensions is extremely limited. Therefore, En - and other projects based on it - attempt to conform to a specific style and naming conventions.

(This is currently a little aspirational as the En style got worked out, but will be fixed over time)

All code in the default state is generated by En and generally should not be modified or extended. Therefore, "En style" is a system of self-enforced function, macro, and variable naming, capitalization, and code organization that enhances code readability and flexibility when using En libraries, especially with other third-party libraries.

Each "En style" script is laid out as follows:

## #define-able Macros ("Options")

Options - macros that are optionally #define-d at the top of the script - are named and capitalized as follows:

- **EN_EVENT_NAME** is a user-defined raw event handler option for raw. When defined, En will pass raw *event_name* LSL events through to the matching lowercase function, such as *EVENT_EN_LISTEN* and *EVENT_EN_TIMER*.
- **ENLIBRARYNAME_EVENT_NAME** is a user-defined En event handler option, like **EN_EVENT_NAME** but used by an En library instead of En itself. Some of these options also inject additional code to handle events; for example, defining *EVENT_ENLEP_MESSAGE* will create a *link_message* event and process any inbound LEP messages, passing valid ones to *enlep_message*, and passing any non-LEP messages to *en_link_message* if *EN_LINK_MESSAGE* is defined.
- **FEATURE_ENLIBRARYNAME_OPTION_NAME** is a library feature option. When defined, En will enable or disable certain library features, such as *FEATURE_ENCLEP_ENABLE* and *FEATURE_ENTIMER_DISABLE_MULTIPLE*.
- **OVERRIDE_TYPE_ENLIBRARYNAME_OPTION_NAME** is a library override option. When defined as a specific value, En's default configurable constants can be overridden on compile, such as OVERRIDE_INTEGER_ENCLEP_RESERVE_LISTENS and OVERRIDE_FLOAT_ENTIMER_MINIMUM_INTERVAL.

Options must be #define-d before #include-ing `libraries.lsl`, which automatically includes each library's `macros.lsl` (including global variables), then each library's `functions.lsl`.

## Global Variables

Global variables are named and capitalized as follows:

- **_ENLIBRARYNAME_GLOBAL_NAME** is an internal library global variable that the script should not access directly, such as *_ENCLEP_DOMAINS* and *_ENTIMER_QUEUE*.
- **_enLibraryName_FunctionName** is an internal library function or macro that the script should not call directly, such as *_enCLEP_MultiSayTo* and *_enLSD_BuildHead*.

## Functions and Inline Macros

Functions and inline macros (which are effectively called as functions) are named and capitalized as follows:

- **en_event_name** is a user-defined raw event handler function. When the matching uppercase option is defined, En will pass raw *event_name* LSL events through to *en_event_name*, such as *en_listen* and *en_timer*.
- **enlibraryname_event_name** is a user-defined En event handler function, like **en_event_name** but called by an En library instead of En itself, such as *enclep_message* and *entimer_timer*.
- **enLibraryName_event_name** is a library's event handler function. Scripts do not need to call these because they can be automatically called depending on the feature options, but the naming convention should be used by third-party libraries that use their own event handler functions, which must be called in user-defined event handler functions.
- **_enlibraryname_event_name** is a library's internal event handler that the script should not call directly, such as *_enclep_listen* and *_entimer_timer*.
- **enLibraryName_FunctionName** is a library function or macro callable by the script, such as *enCLEP_Send* and *enTimer_Start*.

# Third-Party Usage

"En style" can be used by other libraries by replacing "en" and "EN" with a prefix of one's choice, such as "myLibraryName_FunctionName" or "myLibraryName_event_name". This allows other libraries to use the same function-based event routing style.

If other libraries are used, they should be #include-d immediately below En's `libraries.lsl`.
